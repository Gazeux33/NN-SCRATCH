# Neural Networks from Scratch

the goal in this project is to create a small and modular library to implements 
a classic neural networks. I was insipred by the architecure of pytorch and tensorflow
to create my classes and functions.

You can do regression, classification and binary classification.

## Features
### Layers
- [x] Linear Layer

### Activation Functions
- [x] ReLU
- [x] Sigmoid
- [x] Tanh
- [x] Softmax

### Loss Functions
- [x] MSE
- [x] CrossEntropy
- [x] BinaryCrossEntropy

### Optimizers
- [x] SGD
- [x] Adam
